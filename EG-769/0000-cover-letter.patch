Subject: [PATCH 0/1] RISC-V: Make R_RISCV_SUB6 conforms to riscv abi standard

Hi all RISC-V folks:

When riscv-objdump is used to generate dwarf information, problems are found, like:
DW_CFA_??? (User defined call frame op: 0x3c)

This error is related to that riscv-objdump does not follow the riscv R_RISCV_SUB6 standard. 
Riscv-readelf is correct because it follows the R_RISCV_SUB6 standard.

There are test cases in https://github.com/zeng-xiao/gnu-bug-fix/tree/main/EG-769
that describe the error in detail.
